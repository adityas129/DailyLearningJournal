# Notes from the Apache Cassandra DSE 220 Course 
## What is Data Modelling? 
Data Modelling is process/language/tool agnostic 
Steps required for data modelling include: 
* Analyze requirements of the domain
* Identify entities and relatinoships - Conceptual Data Model
* Identify queries-Workflow and Access Patterns
* Specify the schema - Logical Data Model 
* Get somethign wokring with CQL- Physical Data Model 
* Optimize and Fine tuning 
* 
Cassandra is highly query driven and when designing Cassandra, it really pays off to understand the applications's workflow and understand the types of queries the application will support.
## Relational DB vs Cassandra 
Note: 
Cassandra differs quite a bit from normal relational data modelling. 
 Main differences are: 
 * Cassandra uses distributed architecture whereas relational db(RDB) have a single point of failure 
 * In RDM, primary keys used for uniqueness. In Cassandra, primary keys are used for that and much much more. 
 * Cassandra can't do joins due to multiple nodes
