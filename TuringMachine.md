# Turing Machine Parable 

A turing machine is basically an abstraction/model of the simplest computer that can be produced. However, the power lies in its simplicity; itcan perform any computation/algorithm/program that any programming language could perform. Therefore, it is implied that any problem that can not be resolved by a turing machine cannot be resolved by any programming language no matter how fancy.
